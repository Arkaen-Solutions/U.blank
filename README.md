# U.blank Unity Template

![Unity Logo](Assets/Arkaen/resourcez/img/unity_logo.png)

Welcome to the Arkaen **U.blank** Unity template! This minimal template provides you with the bare bones to create a new Unity project, stripped of any unnecessary packages, dependencies, and configurations. You're literally starting with a blank canvas!

## Getting Started

To get started, simply clone or download this repository, and open the project folder in Unity. Unity will automatically detect the template as a valid project directory.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Arkaen/U.blank.git
```

After opening the project in Unity, you can start building your game from scratch, adding only the packages, assets, and dependencies you need for your specific project.

---

### Features
- A clean, minimal Unity project structure
- No pre-installed packages or dependencies
- Suitable for any type of Unity project
- Easy to customize and expand upon
- Customization
- To customize the U.blank template, you can simply add or remove assets, packages, and configurations as needed. Use Unity's Package Manager to add packages from the Unity Registry, or import custom assets into the project's Assets folder.

---

As you build your project, you may also want to create additional folders in the Assets folder to keep your project organized. This template allows you to add what you want and not have to worry about the things you do *not* want in it!
